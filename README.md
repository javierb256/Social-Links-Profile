## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

For this project I wanted to become familiar with bootstrap so that was the css framework that I decided to use. I did struggle in the beginning getting used to bootstrap's pre made classes and stylings, but whenever I would get stuck I would refer to the bootstrap documentation as well as look for guides online and video tutorials on youtube. Overall I am happy with what I built and I hope to become more familiar with bootstrap in the future.
